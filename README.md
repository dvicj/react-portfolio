# React Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my README! This is for my Week 20 Challenge, which was to create a Portfolio using React. I learned a lot while doing this, and I am happy to be able to share my experience with you.

[Check out my portfolio here...](https://dvicj.github.io/react-portfolio)

It was my job to ensure my Portfolio had the following features and met these qualifications:

- be an SPA (Single Page Application)
- have navigation titles for: 
    - About Me - with recent photo and short bio. I included a link for a downloadable  resume here 
    - Contact - a form where the user enters name, email and message
    - Project Categories
- Header, Nav, Project, and Footer components 

I was to create this Portfolio, and meet all of the requirements listed above, by using:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- JavaScript
- HTML 
- CSS

I completed this project as a low stakes and personal way to practice using React.js.

## Installation

There is no installation required. Just visit [React Portfolio](https://dvicj.github.io/react-portfolio)

## Usage
Here are some user experience highlights from my page:

- navigation buttons for "ABOUT ME" and "CONTACT" which open corresponding "About Me" and "Contact Me" sections
- navigation buttons for projects, broken down into specific categories
- modals that open when an image is clicked on. Title, description, and links to live url and github repository

## Credits
These are some sources I used to help me along:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Turret+Road?preview.text_type=custom#glyphs)
- [Font Awesome for React](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react)
- [How to use Google Fonts in React.js?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40769551/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-react-js)
- [Add link to Font Awesome icon in React](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57200956/add-link-to-font-awesome-icon-in-reactjs)
- [Download CV by direct download](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55743858/i-want-to-be-cv-direct-downloaded-by-clicking-download-button)

## Learning
Here are the highlights of what I learned and issues I had while writing this code.

- Relearning aspects of HTML and applying them to JSX, like how to import font and icon libraries without having a head section to add them to
- The webpage automatically reloading whenever you save the file is very handy
- Having to do front end/ aesthetic coding again was kind of a shock to the system. It had been so long, and I found making the website actually look good and how I wanted it took longer than making the website functional.
